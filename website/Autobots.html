    <h1> THE AUTOBOTS</h1>

    
    
    <p>This page gives a basic breakdown of four transformers from the autobot faction.<br> <br> these are the original autobots that arrived aboard the ark</p>

    <h3>Optimus prime</h3>

    <img src="Optimusg1.jpg" alt="logo">

    <p>Optimus Prime is the awe-inspiring leader of the Autobot forces. Selfless and endlessly courageous, he is the complete opposite of his mortal enemy Megatron. Originally a mere civilian known as Orion Pax or Optronix, he was chosen by the Matrix of Leadership to command, the first in a number of heavy burdens he has been forced to bear. Another is his bringing of the Transformers' conflict to Earth. Every casualty, human or Cybertronian weighs heavily on his spark. He does not show this side to his soldiers and never succumbs to despair. The Autobots need a decisive, charismatic leader and that is what he gives them. It was that leadership which turned the tide of the Great War.

        On the battlefield, there are few who rival Optimus Prime's prowess. He is easily the strongest of any Autobot his size. When teamed with his Combat Deck and Roller drone, his ion blaster and energon-axe are deadly weapons. He would sacrifice his life to protect his fellow Autobots or those under their care and does so on a regular basis. His compassion for other sentient beings is his only real weakness, and one the Decepticons have taken advantage of time and again... though it's also the source of his strength! </p>


<h3>BumbleBee</h3>

<p>Unflinchingly loyal to the Autobot cause, Bumblebee possesses boundless amounts of bravery and loyalty, in spite of his physically unintimidating stature. His affable nature means that he's quick to befriend almost anyone, particularly humans. </p>

<h3>Hound</h3>

<img src="Hound.jpg" alt="logo">

<p>Hound wishes he were human. The dark, barren metalscapes of Cybertron no longer interest him. Now that Hound has been shipwrecked on Earth, he considers this planet his home. He sees humankind as beautiful and wishes he could interact with their ecosphere the same way they do, to feel what they feel and to see what they see.

    He treasures his job as an Autobot scout, making good use of his ability to project holograms for added disguise. He uses this opportunity to explore the breathtaking caverns and mountainous expanses that Earth provides. He's a meek, benevolent soul, even compared to his fellow Autobots. He gets along with the more blood-thirsty of their ranks but not the most blood-thirsty of their ranks. </p>

    <h3>Ratchet</h3>

    <img src="Ratchet.jpg" alt="logo">

    <p>Ratchet is the Autobots' Chief Medical Officer. If something's broke, he can fix it. Ratchet is known for his irreverent bedside manner; he loves having a good time, and his party-loving nature has given him a dry wit. He is not a particularly mighty warrior, which sometimes leads him to believe that he is expendable. Optimus Prime has trouble convincing Ratchet that this is far from the truth.

        Although he's a healer, Ratchet often finds himself on the front lines of combat and, on occasion, the last hope the Autobots have. These pressures are sometimes too much for him to handle, but Ratchet ultimately never gives up. </p>
